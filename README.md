How to setup Artemis On a raspberry Pi 5, includes basic how to setup a raspberry pi 5 from absolute beginner level


## Step 1
Get a raspberry Pi 5
Get a raspberry Pi 5 case
Get a micro sd card
Get a ssd harddrive
Get an ssd Harddrive Case
Get a raspberry Pi 5 USB-C charger
(Get a micro sd card reader if you dont already have a way to read the cart on the pc)

## Step 2
Place the micro SD card into the card reader and then into your pc.
Download Raspberry Pi Imager onto your PC
Run the imager and select Raspberry Pi 5 - In the OS section select Raspberry Pi OS (other) and then Raspberry Pi OS Lite (64-Bit) - in the last section select your micro sd cart location.

In the settings select custom, leave the hostname as is. Select the username as pi and choose a password thats strong but easy to remember. Leave the wireless LAN unchecked if ethernet is picked. In services enable SSH and leave the default password authentication. in options leave it default.

Save then remove the micro sd and place it into the raspberry Pi 5 (Its on the left below the actual Pi there should be a slot that perfectly fits a micro SD)

## Step 3
Open the raspberry Pi 5 case, then remove the hat on the fan port (the white one near the top right of the raspberry pi)

Place the fan charger into the port on the raspberry pi, then place the heat sink (it should be in one of the boxes) on top of the raspberry pi middle section it should align perfectly with it.

Next place the raspberry Pi 5 into the case and close the case. 


## Step 4
Next find a spot where you can have a ethernet cable to connect to the Pi, aswell as a socket for the charger. Connect the charger and the ethernet and the ssd case into the Raspbery Pi. If done correctly the fan should spin a few times and then stop. (The pi has a temperature system to determine when to spin the fan so its normal if it stops spinning.)
